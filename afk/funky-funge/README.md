There's a poster on the UiO stand that no one has been able to decode, maybe you'll be able to?

### Writeup

We had a poster hanging on the wall at the UiO stand with the following text on it:

```
>099-v1811<
v"TG"_"UiO"v
     ^1  <
 > **-   |
 ^276< v <
>::$ ^  `::<
v   @#,<
>:!#^_ ^
```

Turns out that this is [Befunge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge), a ~~horrible~~ weird programming language.

Someone made a really cool website where you can visualize the program flow, check it our [here](http://www.bedroomlan.org/tools/befunge-playground). (Crawl mode recommended.)
